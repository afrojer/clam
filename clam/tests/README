UNIT TEST README
================

To run all the tests, run `all.test`.

## Sample Unit Test Template

Unit tests should be named *.test, and have the form:


    #!/bin/bash
    TEST_NAME="Sample Unit Test Name" #change this
    TEST_DESC="Description of the unit test goes here" #change this
    . _buildup.sh

    # Do whatever you want as your unit test.
    # At the end of the test, set ERRORS=0 if
    # there were not errors. Nonzero means fail.
    ERRORS=1
    error "This test auto-fails"

    . _breakdown.sh


## Helpful Functions

The `_buildup.sh` script defines some helpful function:

### error
Works like echo but prints the string in orange.

### compare
Pass it two images and it compares them. For example:

    compare "img1.jpg" "img2.jpg"
    $FAILED=$?
