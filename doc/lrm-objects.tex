\section{Objects and Definitions}
\label{sec:objdef}
An \emph{object} in \sys{} is either a named collection of \texttt{Channel}s, called an
\texttt{Image}, or a named collection of calculation basis, called a
\texttt{Kernel}. A \texttt{Channel} is a mathematical matrix of numeric values
whose individual components are not directly accessible via \sys{} language
semantics -- \texttt{Channel} values are manipulated via the convolution
operator (see~\ref{sec:convolutionop}). A calculation basis, known as a
\texttt{Calc}, is a collection of either calculation constants
(see~\ref{sssec:calcconstants}) or calculation expressions (see~\ref{ssec:escapedC}),
or both.
