Through the course of this project, there are several things that I learned.
First, I learned that writing a compiler is
much more complicated than I had first imagined. While OCaml's syntax and scanner/parser
integration ease development quite a bit, there was still a lot of code to write.
Second, I learned that the implementation of a backend generator, the definition of
a C API that the generator will use, and the syntax tree that the generator takes as
input are all intensely entwined. It was nearly impossible for us to separate the
design of the C/C++ implementation library from the generator backend, and similarly it
was impossible to separate the backend generator design from the abstract syntax tree
that it took as input.

Finally, I learned that self-motivation in a group setting seems to decrease proportionally
to the number of members in the group. Idealistic dreams of independantly motivated
developers all hacking towards a common goal are naive, and more realistic approaches to
group dynamics must be applied. This means that nagging emails and explicit time spent
on planning and organizing will inevitably save late-night hacking cycles near the end
of the project.
