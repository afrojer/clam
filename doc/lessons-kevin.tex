\begin{itemize}
\item 	Make sure you thoroughly understand the Ocaml examples from class.
\item  	Stay in contact with your team throughout the semester, to make sure 
	everyone is always up to speed.
\item 	Define a clear division of labor early, so work is distributed evenly.
\item 	Do lots of testing, even (especially) for apparently simple cases.
	It's so easy to overlook minor details, and a comprehensive set of tests
	is a great way to ensure you don't break anything.
\item 	At the same time, definitely try to push your language in testing.
	Thinking of ways a coder could break your language forces you to think about
	the details of your implementation.
\end{itemize}
