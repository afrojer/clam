\section{Introduction}
The \sys{} programming language is a linear algebra manipulation language
specifically targeted for image processing. It provides an efficient way to
express complex image manipulation algorithms through compact matrix
operations. \sys{} programs are first compiled into a ''C`` module which is
further compiled into a machine binary by an existing C compiler. This two-step
process is completely automated by the \sys{} compiler, and by default no C code
is output (this can be changed with compiler arguments - see section~\ref{sec:compiling}).

This language reference is inspired by the C reference manual~\cite{DBLP:KernighanR88}.
It details the syntax of the \sys{} language.
