It's the little things that end up being the big things. When we started
the project, we had a good idea of the functionality we wanted to express
in our language, but we did not precisely work out the gritty details of
the entire translation from \sys{} source code to program execution. We
would have benefited greatly by each writing 1 or 2 example programs before
we had ever written a line of code. We could then have reconvened to talk
through our example programs, discussing at a high level what we would
expect the resultant binary to do at each line and the deductive logic that would
allow it to do so. Such a conversation at an early stage would have exposed
a number of deficiencies and redundancies in the language, and led to a
better finished product.
