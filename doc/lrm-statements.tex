\section{Statements}
\label{sec:statements}

Statements in \sys{} always end in a semi-colon. No statement
can return a value. All statements either declare a variable,
define or modify the definition of a variable, or execute
some calculation based on previously declared variables with
the result stored in previously declared variables.
