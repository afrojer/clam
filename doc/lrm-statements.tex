\section{Statements}
\label{sec:statements}

Statements in \sys{} always end in a semi-colon. No statement
can return a value. All statements should either declare a variable,
define or modify the definition of a variable, execute
some calculation based on previously declared variables with
the result stored in previously declared variables, or write an image to a file.
"Statements" consisting of a lone r-value (an identifier,
channel reference, escaped-C string, matrix, or \texttt{imgread()} call)
will be accepted but will perform no useful action - they are evaluated but
their return values are discarded (or are they erased during translation?)
