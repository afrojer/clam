GeBR (or some other name, see below) is a language that uses basic linear-algebraic operations to help manipulate images. Starting with the basic features of an image - pixels and their red/green/blue channel values - users may define their own channels and kernels to extract further information about an image or manipulate it through various convolutions. Common operations such as matrix addition, multiplication and inversion are supported, as well as a wide range of useful mathematical functions. 

Possible language names:
LIP - Linear Image Processing (+1)
MILA - Manipulate Images w/ Linear Algebra
CLAM - Color & Light Algebraic Manipulation/Convolutions, Linear Algebra & Matrices
GeBR - Middle part of "alGeBRa", and a rearrangement of RGB - because it manipulates colors.
