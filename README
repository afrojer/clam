This repository contains all of the compiler source, documentation,
and simple examples to get you started using CLAM. You're probably
reading this because you want to compile and run CLAM. Let's cut to
the chase.

Prerequisites:
	gcc/g++ in your path
	OCaml distribution (ocamlc, ocamlyacc, ocamllex, etc.)

Build CLAM:
	cd clam && make

Run CLAM:
	./clam -i tests/clamsrc/blur.clam -o blur
	./blur tests/lena.jpg lena-blur.png

	See the documentation and clam/tests/clamsrc for more
	information and example programs.

Build CLAM docs:
	You'll need a recent installation of LaTeX with several
	(mostly standard) packages. Note: older TeX distributions
	did not have the pgfgantt package which CLAM relies on
	to generate a timeline Gantt chart. If you use the latest
	MiKTeX (2.9) or TeXLive (2011) you should be OK.

	You'll also need perl.

	cd doc && make

	Produces: clam.pdf
